Make some ggplot graphs of the mtcars dataset with point sizes based on number of cylinders. 
```{r}
library(ggplot2) 

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=wt, y=mpg, size=factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title="Scatterplot of wt vs mpg",
       x="Miles per gallon (mpg)",
       y="Displacement (disp)",
       size="Number of cylinders (cyl)")

```

Read a pdb file

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("1a0m")
pdb
```

Do nma analysis of the pdb file and plot 
```{r}
nma <- nma(pdb)
plot(nma)
```
